# Artificial Intelligence Korea-Canada (AI-KODA) Flutter Application

## Project Overview
Artificial Intelligence Korea-Canada (AI-KODA) is a simple and user-friendly application for gastroenterologists to score the Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) frames as per the latest scoring system i.e., KODA. This application called as AI-KODA score is fully automatic and works on an android phone. The scores are stored in real-time efficiently. It will also help in generating a multi-label image dataset which can be used for developing machine learning and deep learning tasks in this feld.

The application consisted of a secure login system, profle setup, and two modules namely training module and testing module. The training module was taken from the original KODA score after necessary permission from the authors.

The testing module consisted of 2173 frames which were selected from the twenty-eight patient videos (These images are stored in azure cloud and 5 randomly chosen frames are present in `assets/test_images`). Two questions i.e., percentage of Visualized Mucosa (VM) and degree of Obstructed View (OV) were displayed on the application. For each of the question, four options were given to the users where-in only one option in each question could be selected at a time.

In the first question, the four options were: `> 75%` (representing VMscore1), `50–75%` (representing VMscore2), `25–49%` (representing VMscore3), and `< 25%` (representing VMscore4). 
In the second question, the four options were: `< 5%` (representing OVscore1), `5–25%` (representing OVscore2), `26–50%` (representing Vscore3) and `> 50%`(representing OVscore4). Additionally, users can zoom in on each frame for a clearer view before answering the questions.

In the back-end, time taken to analyse each frame is recorded and for each selection in any of the two questions, a numeric ‘1’ was assigned. Rest of the non-selected options were assigned a numeric ‘0’. In this manner, each VCE frame were assigned two labels (VM and OV sub-scores) out of the total eight labels. This assignment was done by the inspiration of one-hot encoding method. It is a method used to convert categorical values to binary value of ‘0’ or ‘1’. Three things were saved in real-time in the form of an excel sheet at the application’s back-end. They were—**(1) option selected for each of the question, (2) their time-stamp, and (3) email ID.**

## AI-KODA Score Application Manual
The **AI-KODA Score Application Manual** is a comprehensive guide designed to help users understand the functionality of the AI-KODA app. It provides detailed instructions on how to navigate the app, use its various features, and effectively score Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) frames. The manual is essential for both new users and those looking to maximize the app's potential. To access the manual, please refer to the documentation included in the repository by the same name.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK: Comes with Flutter
- Android Studio or Xcode: For running the app on an emulator or physical device
- Firebase account: For backend services

### Installation 
#### (run these commands in the terminal)
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/misahub2023/AI-KODA.git
    ```
2. Update flutter and its dependencies: 
    ```bash
    flutter upgrade
    ``` 
3. Check whether flutter is ready for use: 
    ```bash
    flutter doctor
    ```
    Resolve any issues shown by flutter doctor before moving to next steps

4. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

### Google Sheets Setup
1. Create a project in Google Cloud and enable the Google Sheets API.
2. Download the JSON credentials file for a service account and replace the placeholders in the `credentials` field with your actual credentials in `lib/services/sheet.dart`.
3. Create a new Google Spreadsheet and share it with the service account email (client_email from the `credentials`).
4. Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL and replace the placeholder in `spreadsheetId` with your actual spreadsheet ID in `lib/services/sheet.dart`.

### Firebase Setup
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Add an Android app to your Firebase project. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app` directory. A sample of the json file is already in the directory.
3. Add an iOS app to your Firebase project. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and place it in the `ios/Runner` directory and also update `ios/firebase_app_id_file.json`. A sample of the both the files could be found in the mentioned directory.
4. Add your Firebase configuration details to the `firebase_options.dart` file  in `lib` folder by replacing the placeholder values (e.g., `'your-web-api-key'`, `'your-android-api-key'`, etc.) with the actual values obtained from your Firebase project settings.
5. Modify the `pubspec.yaml` file to include the necessary Firebase dependencies:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      firebase_core: latest_version
      firebase_auth: latest_version
      cloud_firestore: latest_version
    ```

### Running the App
1. Connect your device or start an emulator.
2. Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
